### The Problem

This example of the Adapter pattern is based on the classic
conflict between square pegs and round holes.

The Adapter pretends to be a round peg, with a radius equal
to a half of the squareâ€™s diameter (in other words, the radius of
the smallest circle that can accommodate the square peg).
