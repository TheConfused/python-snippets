### Observer Design Pattern

- Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about
  any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

- Maintains a list of dependents and notifies them of any state changes.

### Examples in Python ecosystem:

* Django Signals: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/signals/
* Flask Signals: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/signals/
