## Facade 

Facade (pronounced Fasad) is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified
interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

The facade design pattern helps us to hide the internal complexity of our systems and
expose only what is necessary to the client through a simplified interface. In essence, façade
is an abstraction layer implemented over an existing complex system.

The façade pattern is quite common in life. When you call a bank or a company, you are
usually first connected to the customer service department. The customer service employee
acts as a façade between you and the actual department (billing, technical support, general
assistance, and so on), and the employee that will help you with your specific problem.
